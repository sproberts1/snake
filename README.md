# snake

**Requires Zulu11 JDK for Java 11.0.8**

Must have .txt files in the same directory as the .jar file.

Usage: java -jar SnakeGame.jar map (note: map is an optional command and is one of the .txt files provided. The default map is maze-simple.txt if no argument is provided.)

Use arrow keys to move the snake around the map. Once the game is over, the program will write your high score to the file highscore.txt.
